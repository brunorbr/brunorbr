### As the great Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi once said:

_Hello there!_

I'm Bruno, my pronoums are he/him/his, by the time I am writing this, I'm 30 years old, living in Porto, in the north of Portugal. 

A couple of years ago when recruiters asked me why did I choose the Information Technology branch as my career, I wouldn't know how to answer. Was it because I liked technology? Was it because I was inspired by my older brother, which at the time had been working on IT for around seven years? Was it because it was the trend for the future? All of those were possible answers, but none of them were my truth.

Then it dawned on me: Ever since childhood, I had this will to change the world for the better, and I knew I couldn't do it alone, and as time went by, and I met people and organizations with the same goal that I had, I figured that the IT market might help me engage more people in my mission to change the world for the better.

I've been part of the IT Crowd for the past 8 years, I started out my career as a help desk intern, but since then I have worked as a Support Analyst for a Web Hosting company, Application Support intern for a company that developed an IT Monitoring Application based on Nagios. After a couple of years working with support, I finally found myself working as a Software Tester, I started out as a manual tester and eventually developed an interest in software test automation and that's where my career led me. For around a year I also worked as a Atlassian Consultant, eventually applying my automation skills whenever it was needed, but I eventually figured that Quality Assurance was the career I wanted for myself.

So here I am, working as an QA Engineer for BoostIT, and that's the summary for what I've been doing for most of my professional life.

If you're new to Software Test Automation and you have questions or need any tips on where and how to start, feel free to reach out to me and I'll try to help you to the best of my capacity.
